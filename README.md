# Overview

Love Books is a site that is designed for people who are looking to keep a record of books that they have read, and share their reviews with others. 
Users are able to view books and reviews without needing to create an account. This allows new users to preview the site before registering so they have an idea of what the site is like. 
Some of our main categories are Philosophy, Technology, Fiction, Science, Programming, and much more, for people that are always interested in learning something new. Share with other users your favorites books, and check some recommendations as well.

# Design

## Wireframes

To create the wireframes, I used Figma. I started with the mobile wireframes and worked my way to a larger screen size. Below are the links to the completed wireframes;
